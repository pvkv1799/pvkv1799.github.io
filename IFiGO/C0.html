            <h3>About This Book's On-Line Publication</h3>
            <p>
                The on line publication of this book provides two quite extraordinary assets:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It's FREE.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's perfectable!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A printed book is fixed in form and content, and remains essentially immutable from the moment of its
                publication. So except for the inclusion of a separate list of errata or the subsequent issue of a
                second
                edition, any errors of omission or commission it contains remain unchanged forever. In sharp contrast,
                whatever flaws this on line publication possesses can be readily corrected, if only you, the reader, are
                kind enough to communicate your perceptions to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                If anything substantive has been omitted, it can be added. If anything
                is unworthy of inclusion, it can be excised. If I got anything wrong,
                including typos and diagrammatic and/or commentary errors, it can be
                corrected. If more or better examples are needed, they can be provided.
                And if anything is insufficiently clear, it can be clarified. All that's
                necessary to achieve a “perfect” presentation is for the reader to
                provide me with the appropriate positive feedback.
                Just click the link below or at the end of any chapter, and send me an
                email detailing the problems you perceive, and - this is most important -
                specifics of exactly what you suggest as their correction. This is not
                quite like Wikipedia, where the reader can directly modify the
                presentation, but it's close.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order for this process to be successful, when you provide your
                feedback it's essential that you include your rating (AGA or other), so
                that I can properly evaluate the perspective from which your caveat has
                originated. Obviously, if a high Dan tells me that I've got something
                wrong it will carry more weight than if a double digit Kyu player makes
                the same claim, but all positive comments will be treated with the
                respect they deserve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, if you like the book, and especially if you're in its target
                audience and agree that it has significantly improved your understanding
                (and rating!), I'd much appreciate your communicating that to me. It's
                really the only thing that will make the vast amount of time and effort
                that went into its creation worthwhile.
            </p>

            <h3> Introduction </h3>
            <p>
                This book is not a Go primer nor even a second book, so it presumes that
                the reader intending to profit from it already has a firm grasp (if
                perhaps not yet complete mastery) of the basic rules of Go, as well as
                the fundamentals of life and death, <a
                    title="An analyzed sequence of plays which theoretically leads to a dynamically equal local result for both sides"
                    href="./CG.html#Joseki">Joseki</a>, and <a title="The full board Opening"
                    href="./CG.html#Fuseki">Fuseki</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When deciding whether or not it will be worth the time and effort
                necessary to profit from a Go tutorial such as this, the most relevant
                criterion employed will almost necessarily be the amount and rapidity of
                improvement in your rating that you can expect in return. Although it's
                manifestly impossible to correctly assess this without an in-depth
                appraisal of your individual intellect and countless other factors, some
                highly relevant insight into this matter can nevertheless
                be gained from considering the author's own experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                As originally conceived, this book's objective was to provide players
                from double digit to perhaps 5 Kyu with crucial insights into the key
                issues of deciding what, where, and why to play next. But as a result of
                my own experience, I've just come to realize that the range of players
                who can find in it the insights that can and will lead to significant
                improvement in their Go skill (and rating) extends at least to 1D AGA!
                How and why I've come to that startling conclusion is related next.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the possible rare exception of a few geniuses at the very top of
                the Go professional ratings, every Go player throughout its extensive
                history has eventually reached a skill and rating plateau which they
                never thereafter exceed. For many players,
                intermediate plateaus also often hold sway for a number of months or
                even years, but ultimately a final, highest level is reached and then
                continues until age induced decline takes over, if the player is
                fortunate enough to live that long. As I've observed during the 60 years
                of my own Go playing experience, depending on the player these final
                plateaus range all the way from high double digit Kyu for the least apt
                (most of whom drop out in frustration),
                to high ranked 9P. But the one seemingly invariant factor characterizing
                them all is that once a certain amount of time has elapsed (typically
                10 years or more), or age has been reached (typically 60-65), the
                player's then operative plateau is final, and is never thereafter
                transcended!
            </p>
            <p>
                But what has just happened in my own Go playing life violates both of
                those seemingly impenetrable time barriers! I'm now 83, suffering from
                the incurable, invariably fatal Acute Amyloid Leukemia, and have been at
                a 1D AGA plateau for over 20 years. But despite that, my latest results
                definitively demonstrate that I'm now no weaker than 3D AGA, and most
                probably 4D, and, perhaps most startling of all, am unquestionably still
                improving! When I watch games on IGS between players rated 4D* (= 7D
                AGA) and above, I now quickly and easily find their exact moves a vast
                majority of the time! The key that the reader should be aware of is that
                this ability didn't develop immediately after I had organized the key
                ideas and translated that into this book, but only reached its current
                state of fruition after another couple of years of integration of those
                ideas into my thinking. But as noted, I'm quite old by any standard and
                consequently undoubtedly more fixed in my thinking than the average
                player who will read this book, so I have every confidence that those of
                you who put forth the requisite effort can, as I've done, reap rewards
                of Go rating beyond your fondest expectations!
            </p>
            <p>
                Now about the book itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its most fundamental level, playing Go is heavily dependent upon
                pattern recognition. As a result, an essential factor in progressing
                from beginner to intermediate and beyond is perfecting knowledge of the
                key recurrent local patterns, especially as embodied in <a
                    title="A Suji which raises the overall efficiency of the player's local (and sometimes global) stones to their highest possible level"
                    href="./CG.html#TESUJI"> Tesuji </a> and <a
                    title="An analyzed sequence of plays which theoretically leads to a dynamically equal local result for both sides"
                    href="./CG.html#Joseki">Joseki</a>.
                This knowledge constitutes the tactical bedrock upon which Go
                skill is built, but even its mastery is insufficient to make one a
                strong player! What's missing is the ability to visualize and then act
                appropriately on those patterns in actual global board contexts,
                and that latter capability can only be realized in the service of key
                strategic ideas like those developed in this book. Preeminent among
                these key ideas is that fighting is the heart and soul of Go, to the
                degree that the final outcome of a high proportion of well played games
                is decided directly or indirectly by big battles. For that reason,
                mastering the art of fighting is one of the most productive of the
                essential steps in becoming a strong player.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two quite different but equally essential aspects of fighting:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Deciding where, when and why it's appropriate to fight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knowing how to fight.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This book focuses on the former. Its basic premise is that a fully
                developed skill arsenal is unquestionably essential to becoming a strong
                player, but is insufficient because the full value of that skill can
                only be realized in the service of deep strategic understanding. It's
                much like driving a car - technical driving skill is essential for
                maneuvering safely and efficiently in traffic, but useless for getting
                where you want to go without an adequate road map!
            </p>
            <p>
                So the focus in this book is on how to identify which fights are
                necessary and/or productive and which should be avoided, rather than on
                how to conduct a fight once it's begun. It attempts to do what many
                believe impossible - to explain this essential aspect of Go to beginners
                and intermediates so clearly and concisely that they will thereafter
                think much like strong players, even if they're still far from being
                able to consistently translate that understanding into fully accurate
                and incisive play.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of necessity, we do discuss the details of some fights, because it can
                be very helpful to the reader to see the sort of complications that may
                result from the implementation of the ideas being studied. But even in
                those cases, our emphasis is on identifying plausible moves which
                fulfill the position's overall strategic objectives, rather than on
                finding those that are absolutely best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, it must be understood that although this book provides a
                valuable road map for Go fighting in the form of a set of simple but
                important strategic ideas which are generally (but certainly not always)
                applicable, those protocols must be viewed as neither absolute
                prescriptions that must be slavishly followed, nor unerring guides to
                the absolutely best moves!
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite that important caveat, the book's premise is that mere exposure
                to these key ideas will provide the greatest increase in any
                beginner/intermediate's playing strength for the least effort expended!
                But, as desirable as that is, it's only a good first step. Completing
                the transformation into a strong player will also take much study and
                practice of the detailed techniques of Go, as well as lots of
                over-the-board playing experience - all things well beyond our present
                purposes, and which are therefore left for your independent effort.
            </p>
            <h3>
                The Use Of Ratings In This Book
            </h3>
            <p>
                Except as otherwise noted, all of the illustrations in this book were
                taken from actual Dan level games played on leading on-line Go servers,
                and that means that the stated ranks are all really equivalent to 1- 3
                stones stronger on the AGA scale! So although 5D may not seem all that
                impressive, when you realize that it's really equivalent to from 6D-8D
                AGA and therefore among its highest rated players, that player's
                judgment about where to play becomes much easier to accept as valid.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Acknowledgement
            </h3>
            <p>
                I hereby pay my respects and acknowledge my debt to all of the many
                wonderful Go teachers and authors who have preceded me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks are hereby offered to the vetters of this book's original
                incarnation, Ray Kukol 4D, Lisa Maloney, Michael Quintero, Dale Blann,
                Masaaki Hamaguchi, and my son Randy, who were kind enough to review the
                manuscript, find errors, and offer some insights into places in which it
                needed clarification and/or modification. Thanks are also offered to
                Joanne Phipps 3D and Louis Abronson 5D, who vetted the revised
                manuscript, found some significant errors, and made key suggestions that
                helped me reedit it yet again.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in the end, because I'm a Beethoven and not a Mozart, I once more
                rethought and completely recast everything, so that although much of the
                book's content is essentially the same as in the earlier versions, the
                presentation is now completely different. As a consequence,
                responsibility for what appears here, including any errors, remains
                uniquely mine .
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, special thanks are offered to Jakob Meulengracht for his
                invaluable assistance in preparing the HTML coding of the manuscript
                that allowed its on line publication.
