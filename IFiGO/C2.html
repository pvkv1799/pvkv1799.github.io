			At each turn, the player’s primary task is to find the globally best 
move in the current position! In doing this, appropriate tradeoffs must 
be made between 
			many diverse yet complementary factors (e.g. territory vs. influence,
 attack vs. defense, etc.) if a good result is to be achieved.<br><br>
			But those essential factors are really useful only after you have successfully identified:<br>
			   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Which stones are globally important and which are not, and<br>
			   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Whether the important stones are strong or weak<br><br>

					There are seven (7) ways in which this importance is manifested.<br><br>

									<strong>Diagram 1</strong> In this early middle game between 
two 5D players, the only areas now fully controlled are A (Black) and B 
(White).
									 They are somewhat different because although the Black “A” 
group is alive and takes about 8 points of territory, it’s almost 
completely contained 
									and is therefore unimportant to the future course of play! The 
White “B” stones are somewhat important because they impact the adjacent
 still unsettled marked Black stones.<br><br>
									Although Black almost has control of the C and D areas, both 
are still open to a White invasion so these stones are at least 
moderately important.<br><br>
									The game’s main focus from this point on will center on the 
fact that each side has a large (marked), still unsettled group in the 
lower center. Black’s group has much better eyeshape, 
									but White has more open space available, so there’s no real 
advantage on that score at the moment to either side.<br><br>

making it vulnerable to attack.

large move on the right side, W82 - 92 shocked him by developing the 
marked White stone to cut the big Black center group apart, 
									leaving it with portions already dead and the remainder with 
only one sure eye. So Black resigned.<br><br>

									Instead of B81, if Black had recognized that he was so 
vulnerable to being cut apart, the simple play at 83 would have trapped 
the marked White stone, not only creating a sure eye for Black 
									but also essentially unifying all his local forces. After that,
 given his solid positions in all 4 corners, the game would have favored
 him.<br><br>

									<strong>Diagram 5</strong>
									In this early Fuseki position between two 5D players, B5 instead of the more customary B7 was a slightly atypical conclusion to the popular Joseki in the upper left corner.<br>
									After this, if W6 at “a” to approach the upper right corner stone, B“b” would happily squeeze while creating an ideal Black formation in the upper left.  So if White wants to prevent Black from getting too much territory locally that way, he has little choice but to invade with W6 as shown.<br>
									<br>
								</td>
							</tr>
					</tbody></table>
					<br><br>

					Although this is a reasonable strategy for White, the price he must
 pay for it is allowing the blocking attachment of B7. This threatens to
 continue at 8 to make perfect shape for Black while seriously damaging 
W6, so it induces W8 to prevent that.<br><br>
					But that gives Black the opportunity of making a large knight’s 
extension from the upper right corner stone with B9, which does double 
duty by also preventing White from creating his own base via the ideal 3
 point skip third line extension to “a” from the 
					2-stone base of W6-8.<br><br>
					The result as shown is a newly created  W6-8 group that must flee 
baseless into the open center, and this is a large part of the reason 
that the somewhat “unconventional” B5 was such a strong move!<br><br>
					Although W10 was the move actually chosen next to flee into the 
center, any of W “c”, “d”, “e” or “f” might in some circumstances be 
preferable alternatives, the choice between them depending on the 
location of other nearby stones of both colors, and White’s strategy.<br><br>
					Here’s another excellent example.<br><br>

					<strong>Dia 7</strong> When B1 sealed off some eyespace and 
territory in the corner, a Black followup at 2 would have created a 
powerful pon nuki eye shape, inducing W2 to prevent that.<br><br>
					In turn, W2 threatened to follow with at 3 to seal in the Black corner, so Black somehow had to prevent that.<br><br>

					B“a” next would get Black safely out, but wouldn’t apply much 
stress to either the White position on the right or the left, nor would 
it also look forward to playing at 5.  So, on balance, B3 here was best.<br><br>
					Next, White would dearly have liked to play at 5 to make good shape
 while blocking Black’s progress, but the weakness of the lone White 
stone to the left made W4 necessary to provide the beginnings of a base 
there.<br><br>
					That in turn allowed B5 to occupy White’s key shape point, making 
W6 necessary to provide the White stones on the right with their own 
base.<br><br>

					<strong>Dia 8</strong> In this position, a few moves after that of Dia 7, whoever plays first locally has an enormous advantage!<br><br>

					<strong>Dia 9</strong> If it was White’s turn, W1 would provide 
eyespace, stabilize his stones, and also greatly diminish both the 
territorial and eyemaking potential of the 4 Black stones to its left.<br><br>

									  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Threatens to follow with B“c”, to 
seriously undercut (and attack) the still unsettled White 2-stone group 
to its right.<br><br> 
									B“b” instead would be a mistake because it would induce W“c”. 
Then if B 2, White would have Sente for W“a”and that would be bad for 
Black (as already noted).<br><br>

					<br><br>

					B2 instead of B1 would also be wrong!  Not only would that make 
Black overconcentrated, but, instead of defending via W“b” (which would 
leave White overconcentrated himself and allow B1 after all!), White 
would simply answer W“a”,with advantage.<br><br>

					After the correct B1 the diagonal extension of W2 was prudent, and 
not strictly Gote because it not only  provided White’s own eyespace 
while making B“b” or “c” ineffectual, but also threatened W“d” to 
destroy Black’s base in the corner at an appropriate later moment.<br><br>

							But that exchange favors Black, because B1 is a cutting stone 
which may later either cause White problems or force him to expend 
resources to ensure its capture, while W2 merely adds an insignificant 
amount 
							of extra strength to an already very solid White formation! The 
difference between Dia 14 and 15 may be small and subtle, but it’s the

					To better understand the meaning and implementation of this 
important concept, let’s look at an example from an early middle game 
position contested between two 5D players.<br><br>

					<table>
							<tbody><tr>
								<td valign="top" align="left">
									<img src="Chapter%202%20-%20Important%20Stones_files/C2D19.jpg" border="1">

									<strong>Diagram 19</strong> As things stand now, the marked 3 
stone White wall seems not only strong (it has 6 liberties and a large 
adjacent open area), 
									but it’s also unquestionably considered very important by both 
players because it sketches out the beginnings of a huge White moyo on 
the lower side, in 
									conjunction with the two Whites on the right.<br><br> 
									But watch how that appraisal changes in what follows, as both 
sides evaluated the evolving dynamics as they continued from this 
position.<br><br>



								</td>
							</tr>
					</tbody></table>
					<br><br>					

					<table>

							<tbody><tr>
								<td valign="top" align="left">
									<img src="Chapter%202%20-%20Important%20Stones_files/C2D20.jpg" border="1">
									
								</td>

								<td width="10">&nbsp;</td>
								<td valign="top" align="left">
									<br><br>
									<strong>Diagram 20</strong> Black concluded that, despite 
appearances, the 3 marked White stones were vulnerable, so he attacked 
very aggressively with B1 to 
									prevent them from readily making a base and too much secure 
territory on the lower edge.<br><br>

									W2 counter-squeezed B1, because at the moment that lone Black 
stone is weaker than the 3 stone White group! His objective was to 
prevent Black’s easily making 
									a base for that lone stone, while beginning to sketch out a 
substantial White  territory between W2 and the lower right corner 
stones.<br><br>


								</td>
							</tr>
					</tbody></table>
					<br><br>					
					Then, after the brief sequence of B3 thru B7 that followed, White 
apparently realized that the influence the 3 stone wall had formerly 
been providing had essentially ceased to exist, with the result 
					that his evaluation of those 3 stones had suddenly changed, not 
just from an important valuable asset to one that was relatively 
unimportant, but to an actual potential detriment!<br><br>
					So White concluded that running out to save those 3 stones in the 
current global position would be counterproductive. Instead, it would be
 better to change strategy, and rather than trying to save those 
					3 stones to use them as sacrifices in order to help consolidate as 
much of his lower right territory as possible! So ...<br><br>

					<table>
							<tbody><tr>
								<td valign="top" align="left">

									<br><br><br><br><br><br>

									<strong>Diagram 21</strong> The result: The formerly important 3
 White stones have become Black prisoners, but in return White has 
consolidated about 30 points of territory in the lower right corner!<br><br>
 



								</td>
							</tr>
					</tbody></table>
					<br><br>					

					The key idea to grasp is that <br><br>
					<i>White didn’t view his 3-stone wall as a fixed asset, but rather 
as just another potential bargaining chip, which he was prepared to 
trade in at any time if sufficient compensation was available to make 
that transaction profitable for him.</i><br><br>

					If you proceed with that kind of flexible attitude, as your skills 
advance with experience you won’t be confronted with the need to change 
your mental perspective in order to realize the rating improvement that 
should rightly be your due!<br><br>
					Now let’s try a few problems to see how well you not only 
understand these concepts, but can recognize them as they occur in real 
game situations.
