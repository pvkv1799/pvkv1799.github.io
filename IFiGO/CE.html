Applying What You've Learned
</font>
<font size="+1">
<br><br>

If this book has successfully realized its design intent, a double digit
 Kyu reader who finishes it should have acquired a set of new ideas 
which provide a much improved understanding of how high level Go is 
played. That’s a necessary first step, but real, sustained improvement 
will only result when those ideas have been permanently embedded in your
 thinking processes, so that their application has become an automatic, 
almost instantaneous response, rather than requiring the conscious 
application of a mental checklist. To realize that goal, there is no 
adequate substitute for playing many, many games, getting practical 
experience in implementing those ideas in the face of determined and 
competent opposition. <br><br>

But that raises a serious problem for most beginners/intermediates, 
because they will typically be playing most of their games against 
“equal” or only somewhat stronger opposition.  The difficulty this 
presents is that the caliber of those opponents is not likely to be 
sufficiently high to afford the opportunity to confront (and therefore 
learn to counter) the most incisive moves. The unfortunate consequence 
is that it will often be possible to get by and even prevail with 
inferior plays that the far stronger opponents you will encounter later 
in your Go career will almost certainly severely punish. And so, despite
 your best efforts, by playing against only equal or marginally stronger
 opponents you will almost necessarily be learning many “things that 
ain’t so”, which will therefore later have to be unlearned if you are to
 make the much desired advance to the higher skill levels.<br><br>  

Fortunately, it’s relatively easy to transcend this important difficulty
 by watching/studying the games of professionals and amateurs who are 
strong enough to make few egregious errors. In earlier, less technically
 sophisticated times, being able to watch such strong players on any 
kind of consistent basis was impossible for any but the relatively few 
fortunate individuals who lived in communities in which there was a 
large local Go club with sufficiently strong members. But today, being 
able to do this is feasible for everyone, 24/7, through the advent of 
the internet!<br><br>

are by far the largest internet Go communities in the world, and also 
the preferred home of many of the world’s top ranked professionals, a 
number of whom play there regularly, albeit mostly anonymously. For 
these reasons, they’re my preferred choice. But some of the ethnic Go 
servers (especially the Chinese and Korean) are perhaps even stronger, 
so for those for whom the language barrier isn’t a problem they form an 
excellent (or even superior) alternative.<br><br>

But watching the games of professionals or the very highest rated 
amateurs is IMHO not the best way to proceed, at least for the “average”
 double digit beginner/intermediate! The reason is that the highly 
refined technique and exquisite positional judgment of these 
ultra-strong players enables them to employ strategy that is often 
essentially incomprehensible to anyone not close to their own 
stratospheric skill level. So until you’ve reached at least low single 
digit Kyu rating you will be well advised to concentrate your watching 
on players in the 1d to 5d range, where the strategy employed will 
usually be more or less comprehensible to you, while the protagonists’ 
technique will still be sufficiently well developed to minimize most 
egregious errors.<br><br>

But even that isn’t sufficient, because in order to really profit from 
your watching it must be an active rather than a merely passive 
experience!<br><br>

What this means is that move-by-move you must mentally assume the role 
of each player in turn, evaluating the whole board situation, performing
 your own SWOT Analysis, and deciding on what you believe should be the 
best next move. Then as the player actually makes his move you must 
compare that with your own idea, and, in the many cases in which they 
differ, try to figure out why the move actually played was preferable to
 your own choice.<br><br> 


Since this process of analyzing the differences will typically take much
 more time than is available between moves in real time, in order to be 
able to adequately conduct this kind of analysis, it will usually be 
necessary to save the game and then replay it later at your own pace. 
Although that may seem to be a lot of extra work, the payoff for going 
through this exercise on a regular basis can be immense!  The ultimate 
result will be that, perhaps slowly and possibly quickly but in any 
event surely, you will begin noticing that your own move choices and 
those of the strong players you are watching will become identical more 
and more of the time, as your playing strength soars as well!<br><br>

If ever there was a “royal road” to Go mastery, this is it! And it’s fun as well - “the best of all possible worlds”.<br><br>  Enjoy!<br><br>
