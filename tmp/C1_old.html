The financial investment model is an appropriate, if rather grossly 
simplified, way to grasp the essence of a Go game. Think of the stones 
you play as your investment capital, 
and the resulting territory you acquire as the return on that 
investment. It’s well established that a prudent financial strategy 
invariably requires a judicious balance between 
long and short term investments. It’s much the same in a Go game, where 
the balance that must be struck is between profit (short term) and such 
relative intangibles as thickness 
and attack (long term). In this balancing process, it’s often feasible 
to cede even a large temporary lead in solid profit to the opponent, in 
the expectation of later recouping. 
But <i>whatever the chosen strategic mix in any given game, at game’s 
end the sole determinant of victory or defeat is the amount of empty 
board space controlled by each side.</i><br><br>
Capturing more stones than the opponent, or even capturing any opposing 
stones at all, is essentially irrelevant except as it contributes toward
 that goal.<br><br> 
Given that fact, it might seem that victory should be achievable through
 the simple walling off of areas by both sides. But that’s not true! 
Even if that primitive strategy (pejoratively 
termed “ground gaining Go”) could be successfully followed initially, 
the finite size of the Go board coupled with the fact that both sides 
are seeking to gain control of the same limited 
amount of space means that conflict is ultimately inevitable. And that’s
 especially true when one side or the other realizes it has fallen 
behind in acquiring territory and can only recoup 
by “stealing” a portion of what the opponent has claimed. So in well 
played Go games the confrontations usually begin early, and then are 
almost invariably crucial in determining the final outcome.<br><br>
As a result, perhaps the major key to making appropriate strategic decisions lies in understanding that:<br><br>

 is all there is to Go, because nothing could be further from the truth.
 Rather, fighting is perhaps best understood as the 
					essence around which all of the many subtleties and complexities of
 Go tactics and strategy coalesce to produce the wonderful game which

					Although most high level Go games are decided as a result of 
fights, those fights are anything but random, mindless conflict for its 
own sake! Quite the contrary. Fights between competent 
					opponents occur only because both sides are unavoidably competing 
for control of the limited assets of space, shape and connectivity 
available on the 361 intersection Go board.<br><br>

					<strong>Fighting Guidelines:</strong>

					In a fencing bout, every legal touch has the same value. So when 
the opponent thrusts, a fencer’s first response must be to parry! Only 
then does it become feasible to initiate an aggressive counter action. 
					In a boxing match, every legal blow has the same point value to the
 judges, but more effective blows can not only steal the initiative from
 the opponent but can also serve to wear him down so that both his 
					attack and defense become less effective. Equally important, they 
can also serve to instantly end the bout via a knockout!<br><br>
					And it’s much the same in Go. A move by the opponent which intends 
to seize Sente by making a threat that you can’t afford to ignore may be
 defended against as expected, but it also may be ignored in favor of 
					a threat of one’s own which is in fact more serious. In each case, 
deciding what’s appropriate strategically and then achieving their 
desires requires accurate positional appraisal followed by precise 
execution 
					by both sides, so in the final analysis a player’s arsenal of 
tactical skills is the foundation upon which his strategy is both built 
and realized.<br><br>
					<i>The crucial factor in the conduct of any fight is the 
realization that each separate group of both White and Black stones must
 somehow form at least two separate and distinct eyes by the end of the 
game</i>, 
					to both remain alive and garner the territory that will count 
toward a win. So the more separate groups you can force your opponent to
 establish, the more “free” moves you gain with which to pursue your own
 objectives. 
					This is generally true because most moves made by the opponent to 
secure his own eyes won’t also expand his space or attack your 
positions!<br><br>
					Because it’s easy for a beginner or intermediate in a handicap game
 to be intimidated by White’s superior skill, it’s also important to 
remember that<br><br>

					So Black must carefully appraise and then seek to exploit any 
weaknesses in White’s positions, rather than reflexively playing purely 
defensively as though the White stones were somehow invulnerable!<br><br>
 
					The following principles provide excellent guidance in most 
situations. Why they’re generally valid will become clearer when we 
discuss strong and weak stones in Chapter 3.

					<strong>The Nature Of Attack</strong><br><br>
					An attack uses threats against weak stones to create gains, either 
locally or elsewhere, which typically take the form of territory 
(profit), the creation of power/influence, or an attack on another 
group.<br><br>
					Attacking plays will usually elicit a response, but won’t necessarily result in an immediate fight.<br><br>

					Attacking scenarios are of almost transcendent importance in 
playing Go and among the most satisfying to implement, so it will be 
worth our while to briefly examine their structure and implications 
here, deferring fuller discussion for later.<br><br>
					In a 2008 article in the AGA e-journal, well known American Go teacher Jim Kerwin, 1P, said the following:<br><br>
					“The key to attacking is to start by choosing where and what you 
want to gain. You will find it difficult at first to see a possible gain
 and how to use attack to get it. The good news is that if you can’t see
 how to use the weak group to get what you 
					want, you can afford to wait. The worst case is that the opponent 
will eventually spend a move to reinforce the group allowing you to play
 a profit move, so you’re guaranteed something.”<br><br>
					
					This is splendid advice, as might be expected from a Go 
professional, but I believe that it’s still amenable to modest 
refinement for the beginners/intermediates who are endeavoring to learn 
from this book.<br><br>
					The relevant issue is the player’s meta-strategy for playing Go in 
any particular game. When engaged in competition in which winning and 
rating are the motivation, Kerwin’s conservative strategy of staying 
within 
					the confines of the player’s current knowledge/skill base except in
 desperate circumstances is clearly appropriate. But in playing “casual”
 Go, especially when expanding your experience base is the dominant 
motivation, a far more adventurous and aggressive 
					strategy will usually be more appropriate!<br><br>
					Given that such “casual” games will almost necessarily constitute 
by far the majority of your early playing experience, rather than 
holding back unless you’re reasonably certain of success as Kerwin 
suggests, in those games your preferred strategy should be 
					to assess as best you can, and then, if in your best judgment it 
seems at all feasible, attack! Then, especially if you later review what
 happened (or use a service like The Go Teaching Ladder to have a much 
stronger player point out your errors), by learning 
					from your mistakes you can maximize your rate of progress.<br><br>

					This may mean that both sides are safe, that one side’s stones are 
either unequivocally dead or temporarily abandoned, or that both are 
still incompletely settled. 
					In the latter cases, the fight will often resume later, when the 
appearance of other stones nearby makes it profitable for one side or

							<strong>Diagram 5</strong> The “Knight’s Move” approach of W1 (or
 the symmetrical point on the upper side) is the most common way for 
White to begin operations against the Black 4-4 point stone.<br><br> 
							Because it’s an attack, it doesn’t make contact with the object 
of that attack, but instead stays a discreet distance away!<br><br>
							When Black is in a position to respond aggressively, the one 
point squeeze play of B2 is the strongest counterattack, also playing at
 a discreet distance from its target, and inhibiting W1's ability to 
expand down the side to make a base there.<br><br>

							Feasible but milder squeeze plays instead of B2 which may be 
globally preferable in some situations are “a” thru “d”, while “e” is 
sometimes chosen when Black feels the top and/or center are more 
important than the left side.<br><br>
							After B2, White has the choice of defending W1 immediately or 
playing elsewhere. (If he tenukis he will suffer a fairly serious local 
detriment if Black is first to play locally again, but even then W1 
can’t be killed.)<br><br>

sometimes preferable), White is not only alive with profit in the 
corner, but is also unconfined.<br><br>
							In return, W1 is at least temporarily abandoned and Black has 
thickness. This dynamic “equality” is a fair allocation of assets for 
both sides for the moment, but not a fully adequate characterization of 
the situation.<br><br>
							The important aspect of this position unaddressed by that  
assessment is that White’s profit of about 10 points in the corner is 
almost (but not quite) already assured, but Black’s thickness on the 
outside must still be sooner 
							or later converted into an approximately equivalent gain either 
locally or elsewhere for this trade to be ultimately fair.<br><br>

strong center influence in return for Black’s sketching out corner 
territory. (The contact play of B6 helps defend the corner territory in 
Sente by threatening to 
							connect underneath to B2 by continuing at 7, thereby inducing W7 
to prevent that.)<br><br>
							After this, with the 3-3 point (“a”) in the corner and “b”, “c”, 
and “d” all still available for White if and when circumstances make 
them appropriate, and with the skirt at “e” also still open, the big

							Then, depending on what’s going on elsewhere, White may play “a” 
immediately to assure his connectivity (the best way to do that), or 
tenuki and hope that he’ll be able to get back to consolidate his 
position here before Black can play to cut him apart.<br><br>

both “make shape” and take some corner/side territory.<br><br>

							<strong>Diagram 10</strong> Relevant to this discussion is the 
“bang against” attachment of B2 here, which, as earlier noted and 
despite its appearance, is primarily an attack and not a defensive move!<br><br>

							Since this is something that seems inconsistent and therefore may be confusing, understanding its rationale is important.<br><br>
							The attachment of B2 is most appropriate when the triangled Black
 stone (or one at “a”) is already in place on the upper side, and is 
even more effective when (as here) the marked left side star-point stone
 is also present (as is true in high handicap games).<br><br>
							The aim of B2 is to make infeasible an immediate White switch to 
the 3-3 point in the corner at “b”, as in Dia 8. It does this because if
 W3 at  “b”to “steal” the corner territory, B4 at 3 would give Black 
excellent eyeshape while severely damaging W1. So  most often 
							W3 is considered necessary.<br><br>

						<br>

							Then B4 works perfectly, in conjunction with the triangled upper 
side star point stone, toward building a large Black territory in the 
upper left corner and adjacent upper side. (Although as noted in Dia 7, 
that territory is still far from completely secure, especially 
							with W“b” still available.)<br><br> 
							After B4 White needs eyespace for his 2 stones, but the marked 
Black left side star point stone stands in the way of an ideal 
extension, leaving only the very short one point skip to W5 as really 
feasible.<br><br>
							Next, B6 prevents a White slide to either “c” or “d” to expand 
his eyespace, after which W7 is necessary to create the beginnings of 
some eyespace and shape while fleeing toward the center. B8 is then 
often best, building Black’s strength and looking toward the lower side.<br><br>
							What’s really important here is to recognize the fundamental 
difference between the almost entirely defensive attachment of B2 in Dia
 9 and that of Dia 10, which is primarily (but not entirely) offensive.<br><br>
							Once that critical difference is clearly understood, it should 
then be far easier for you to make the proper decisions and appropriate 
followup in similar situations that arise in your own games.<br><br>

							<strong>Enclosure</strong><br><br>

							In the big fights that decide the majority of well played games 
it’s important that each side retain as many options as possible, and 
key among those options is finding support for both attack and defense 
from nearby friendly stones.<br><br> 
							Groups which are enclosed not only can’t simply run away from an 
attack, but are also unable to connect with other friendly stones which 
might offer help, either to win the fight outright or to at least 
survive it.<br><br>
							It’s also true that if one side is enclosed it’s almost 
necessarily disconnected from other friendly groups, and in many (but 
not all) cases that also means that the opponent is connected.<br><br>

							The result is that when  looking at the final position of games 
which are close enough to count, it will much more often than not be 
true that the side which has the fewest number of groups (= is best 
connected!) is the winner!<br><br>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Must be able to make 2 eyes, or die.<br><br>
					Caution! As the board fills up throughout the game, every group 
will ultimately become enclosed! So the guidelines we discuss here apply
 primarily during the Fuseki and early middle game. <br><br>
					It’s also true that all such “rules” of behavior represent 
simplifications of often quite complex situations, but they are 
nevertheless quite valuable because in surprisingly many cases they also
 provide the clues that can allow even beginning players to find
